# Online Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a prework study guide to help provide some notes and basic information to help students get started with full-stack programming.

I built this guide both to practice the basic principles of programming with the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS languages, as well as learning how to properly update and integrate code projects using GitHub. It serves as both a literal guide and a model for projects to come.
